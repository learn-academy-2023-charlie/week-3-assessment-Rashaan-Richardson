# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Your answer:
JSX stands for JavaScript syntax extension. JSX allows us to use React syntax that is similar to HTML. A huge difference is you must return one element or it wont complie. Which is why we use '<></>'

Researched answer:

JSX stands for JavaScript syntax extension. It is a JavaScript extension that allows us to describe React's object tree using a syntax that resembles that of an HTML template. It is just an XML-like extension that allows us to write JavaScript that looks like markup and have it returned from a component.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming:

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

2. Ruby:

Ruby is mainly used to build web applications and is useful for other programming projects. It is widely used for building servers and data processing, web scraping, and crawling. The leading framework used to run Ruby is Ruby on Rails, although that's not the only one.

3. Implicit return:

If a JavaScript arrow function immediately returns a value, writing return is optional (if we also remove the curly brackets). The return is then implied, making it an “implicit return”.

4. Ruby blocks:

Ruby blocks are little anonymous functions that can be passed into methods. Blocks are enclosed in a do / end statement or between brackets {} , and they can have multiple arguments. The argument names are defined between two pipe | characters.

5. Ruby hashes:

A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" = > "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index
